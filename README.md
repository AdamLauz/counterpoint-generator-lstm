# counterpoint-generator-lstm
Generate counter point melody given cantus firmus using LSTM model. 

## Model
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) [[1]](#1) model is trained on sequences of cantus firmus and counter point melodies.

## Data
Dataset for training the LSTM model is from http://www.mscorelib.com.
Sample of about 100 Bach's pieces are included in this project.
